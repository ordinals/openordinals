    The Open Ordinals Institute, a California nonprofit corporation
    in the process of applying for 501(c)(3) status, is a public charity
    dedicated to nurturing and upholding a thriving ecosystem for
    the free and open-source development of the Bitcoin Ordinals
    protocol. We are staunch believers in the essential role of
    free and open-source software for the future of the internet
    and the world.
    <br>
    <br>
    The Open Ordinals Institute supports its mission through our contributor program by supporting open source
    developers in efforts that align with the organization's goals.
    <br>
    <br>

    activities:

      <li>Development and enhancement of the ordinals protocols</li>
      <li>Empowering underserved individuals with the tools and knowledge to access the bitcoin and ordinals ecosystem
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <br>
    The board considers a contributor's application under the following criteria:
    <br>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Capabilities and expertise</li>
      <li>Alignment with the organization's mission</li>
      <li>Attention to detail</li>
      <li>Creative problem-solving skills</li>
      <li>Mentoring experience</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <br>
    Contributors must receive a majority approval by the board, and are expected to provide regular progress updates to
    the board.
